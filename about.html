              <h2>The Origin Story</h2>
              <p>The idea for Vision Sports Analysis was born when company co-founder and CEO Javier started a voluntary role at Bristol Rovers Woman F.C as a sports analyst. He built his own analysis system watching videos of the games and creating an advanced excel spreadsheet to record statistics and information. This led to the idea to create a software program that does away with any time-consuming manual tagging, in order to provide highly accurate statistics in a fraction of the time from recorded footage.</p>

              <h2>The Company's Vision</h2>
              <p>The company was founded in June of 2020, when Javier teamed up with Felix, who oversaw developing this cutting-edge program, and Tom, who oversaw developing the website to allow this software to be accessible for users. The team shared the aim of bringing this excellent analysis tool to teams of all levels, that was previously exclusive to the professional level, and to give coaches more time for the most important part of their job, spending time working with their players. In addition, the team wanted to create a platform where coaches would be able to gain access to a library of great session ideas and join a community where individuals could share and discuss coaching plans.</p>

                <p>Javier has been coaching football for over 10 years and has worked with many players from grassroots to youth international players. He built his own tagging analysis program which gave him the idea to develop an advanced software with the potential to analyse footage and provide game statistics to coaches and analysts.</p>
                <p>Javier teamed up with Felix and Tom, forming Vision Sports Analysis in the aim to provide sports clubs, at all levels, the analysis tools to develop their game like the professionals.</p>
